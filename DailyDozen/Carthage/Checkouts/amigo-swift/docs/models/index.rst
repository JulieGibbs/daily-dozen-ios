Models
=================================

Amigo works by mapping your data models derived from a
:code:`Amigo.AmigoModel` into an :code:`Amigo.ORMModel`

There are 2 way you can perform this mapping.

1. Use a Managed Object Model
2. Manual Mapping

The Managed Object Model mapping just automates the Manual Mapping
process.
