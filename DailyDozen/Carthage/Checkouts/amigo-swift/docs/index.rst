Welcome to Amigo!
=================================

A SQLite ORM for Swift 2.1+ powered by `FMDB <https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb>`_


But What About CoreData?
------------------------

Yup, CoreData...


Requirements
------------------------

 - Swift 2.1 (aka iOS 9+, os x 10.11+)
 - CoreData


The Deal
------------------------

So, we like CoreData, but we also like ORMs in the flavor of SQLAlchemy
or Django's ORM. So lets make that happen, however unwisely, in Swift.
To that end you could say at this point that Amigo was firstly inspired
by the version of Amigo we wrote for C#/Xamarin which you can find here:

https://github.com/blitzagency/amigo

But what if we just want to work in Swift you say? Well, lets rewrite
Amigo in Swift then! So we did. It's a start. A start that shamelessly
copies, probably poorly, ideas found in SQLAlchemy and Django.
